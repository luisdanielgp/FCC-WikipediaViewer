## Code

I used Wikipedia's API:  https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page

Heres an API sandbox for experimenting with Wikipedia's API: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:ApiSandbox#action=query&titles=Main%20Page&prop=revisions&rvprop=content&format=jsonfm

I used bootstrap 4 for the styling.

I used Plain Javascript and some jQuery for getting the JSON and displaying search results.

# What did I use?

This site was originally coded in Codepen:
- Codepen.io
- Atom text editor for organizing files before uploading to GitHub.
- Google Chrome, specially Chrome's console for debugging everytime my code didn't work.

# Finally

Feel free to take the code and customize it as you wish. It's useful for practicing basic API concepts.

### Thanks for reading.
